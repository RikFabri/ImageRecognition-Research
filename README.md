# Prologue
Normally, it's difficult to plan out research. It's done when the research question has been answered, or the hypothesis been disproven.
I'm not quite there yet. So I'll discuss the details of what I did experiment with in more detail.


# Research question
How can we apply machine learning to unity, to achieve image recognition in games?

# Research
The research question can be broken down in two main parts
> How does image recognition work?

> How to use neural networks in unity?

I decided to use [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [python 3](https://www.python.org/) for the machine learning, since those are the most prevalent tools at the moment. 
For unity I stumbled upon [barracuda](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.barracuda@1.2/manual/index.html), which is an experimental library to easily handle neural networks.
