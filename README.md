# ImageRecognition-Research
This is a project where I'll be researching machine learning with the end-goal of making a simple, gesture based game in mind.
This readme will be kept up-to-date with progress and explanations of the relevant subjects.

The current direction I'll be going in, is figuring out convolution neural networks with tensorflow.
